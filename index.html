            <h1>Krug Programming Language</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
            Krug is a programming language for systems programming. The compiler
            is a compiler-as-a-service, which means that the compilers runs as
            a server. Each compilation phase is cut up into an API route which
            can be invoked from a client. 
        </p>

        <h2>Try Krug</h2>
        <p>
            The language is a work in progress. Nothing works yet, and the language/compiler
            is far from stable. You can still try and get a krug program to compile.
        </p>
        <h3>Using the JS frontend</h3>
        <p>
            Krug offers a few choices in frontend, the standard frontend
            being 'krug', a frontend that is implemented in JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
            JavaScript was chosen to be the main frontend due to its availability. You will
            need a few things to get started:
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>yarn (or npm)</li>
                <li>node</li>
                <li>krug-serv</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            First, ensure that an instance of 'krug-serv' is running locally on your machine. It 
            should be running, by default, on port 8001. Take a look at the <a href='//github.com/hugobrains/krug-serv'>krug-serv repository</a>
            to find out more.
        </p>
        <p><pre>yarn add global krug
krug hello_world.krug</pre>
        </p>

        <h3>krug-go</h3>
        <p>
            Additionally, there is a frontend that is written in Go. This was the initial
            frontend, though krug was later made the standard frontend due to its
            easy adoption. If you want to use the Go version of the krug frontend, 
            there are further instructions on the <a href='//github.com/hugobrains/krug-go'>krug repository</a>, 
            though it is not as actively maintained as krug at this time.
        </p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>
            There are many goals for this project, here are some that are not so obvious:
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Setup a server to run a compiler instance for demoing the frontend(s). This would
                    be running at 'serv.krug-lang.org'.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Have a compiler frontend written in Krug very early on in the development of the
                    compiler.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Potentially support LLVM as the (core) code generation framework for the compiler.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </body>
